                            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes<br>
                            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br>

                            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."<br>

                            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and<br>

                            <br>

                            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
                            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
                            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br>
                            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br>

                              <br>
                            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
                            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
                            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
                            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br>
                            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br>
                            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br>
                            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br>
                            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br>
                            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br>
                            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>
                            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>
                            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br>
                            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>
                            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>
                                as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
                            <br>
                            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br>
                             Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br>
                            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>
                            meet the following conditions:<br>
                            <br>
                            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
                          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                            <br>
                            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
                                stating that You changed the files; and<br>
                            <br>
                            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br>
                            that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>
                                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>
                                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>
                                the Derivative Works; and<br>
                            <br>
                            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br>
                            distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>
                            include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>
                                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>
                            pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>
                            of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>
                            as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>
                            documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>
                            within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>
                                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>
                            of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>
                            do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>
                            notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>
                            or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>
                            that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>
                            as modifying the License.<br>
                            <br>
                            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>
                            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>
                                for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>
                             for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>
                            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>
                                the conditions stated in this License.<br>
                            <br>
                            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>
                            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>
                            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>
                            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>
                            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>
                            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>
                                with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
                            <br>
                            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>
                            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>
                            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>
                                origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br>
                            <br>
                            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>
                            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>
                            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br>
                            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>
                            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>
                            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>
                            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>
                            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>
                                risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
                            <br>
                            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>
                            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>
                            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>
                              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>
                            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>
                            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>
                            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>
                            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>
                            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>
                            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>
                                has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
                            <br>
                            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>
                            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>
                            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>
                            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>
                            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>
                            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>
                            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>
                            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>
                            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>
                                of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br>
                            <br>
                          END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
